	<p>Hematology is the study of blood and blood disorders. hematologists and hemapathologists are highly trained healthcare providers who specialize in the disease of blood and blood components.</p>
	<p>Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder caused when the body doesn't make enough of a protein called hemoglobin which is important part of red blood cells. There are two ain types of thalassemia, the alpha and beta. Different genes are affected for each type, can be mild or severe. Since your body has fewer blood cells, you may have symptoms of a low blood count, or anemia. When you have anemia, you might feel tired or weak. You may also experience:</p>

	<p>The Spleen is an additional organ where blood is produced. It is located directly beneath your lower ribs on the left side of your abdomen. The functions of Spleen are numerous. Blood filtration and blood infection are two of the most important ones. It can begin the process of combatting these infections as soon as it discovers them. The Spleen can enlarge dramatically in thalassemia patients as it attempts to produce red blood cells. It cannot work as hard to filter blood or keep an eye out for and combat infections because it is exerting too much energy on its task. As a result, thalassemia patients are referred to aas "immunocompromised", which denotes a malfuntion in part of the body's defense mechanism against infection.</p>
	
	<h2>Healthy choices for people living with thalassemia</h2>
	<p>Healthy choices a person with Thalassemia should consider include keeping vaccinations up-to-date, eating nutritious meals, exercising, and developing positive relationships.</p>
	
	<li>Vaccines</li>
	<p>Vaccines are a great way of shielding yourself from infections since people with this disease are prone to serious infections that can be dangerous to the health.</p>
	<li>Nutrition</li>
	<p>Eating nutritious foods is important for everyone to maintain a healthy lifestyle. People with thalassemia should limit iron in their diets because it could potentially cuase iron build-ups. It is important to always listen and follow your physician's intrsuctions to maintain a heakthy lifestyle. 
	<li>Exercise</li>
	<p>People with this disease can participate in such activities like biking, running, walking, yoga, swimming, or aerobics. These are moderate exercises they can participate because they may easily feel tired and weak in little workouts.
	<li>Relationships</li>
	<p>Having warm, supportive relationships is an important part of life and romantic relationships can also offer a source of support. If a relationship is becoming sexual, it is important to have healthy decisions, such as getting tested for STIs. Alway consult a physician whether why it is important to consult before having pregnancy so that you and your partner can be informed of the risk of having a child with thalassemia. 
	<p>Ever since I was diagnosed with thalassemia, I was overall cautious of my daily ventures. Unlike most teens enjoy the sunlight and go to beaches, I am limited to even go to the most basic things humans can do. Minutes into exposure in the sun, petechiae appears. I also experienced having transfusions of blood beginning to college due to my enlarged spleen working too hard because my body is not creating enough hemoglobin. I am also pale and mild yellow skin. After I was diagnosed, it explains everything in high school where I would faint in minimal extracurricular activities in my school. Overtime, even though my actions are limited due to the disease I have, I learned to enjoy life normally. I also applied the instructions the doctors gave and it will never hinder me from pursuing and chasing my dreams, to become a registered nurse someday.</p
